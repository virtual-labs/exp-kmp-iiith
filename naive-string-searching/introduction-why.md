### Why we need String Searching?

  -  Surprisingly, strings are more often used in computer science than numbers. May it be editing text documents in word processors, reading our favourite blogs or even a basic search on google.
   - Strings are everywhere. Hence it is important to study and understand the methods to manipulate, traverse and search among them.

### Real Life Applications

Efficient string searching is crucial to the way the internet functions today. They have a plethora of uses and applications:

  -  Spell Checkers
  -  Intrusion Detection systems
  -  Predictive Seach Engines
  - Plagiarism detection
  -  Information Retrieval System etc.

### Basic Approach

If we were to approach this problem of searching for a pattern inside a string, the first trivial solution would be a brute-force method. We will be examining this method in the next task of this learning unit.
