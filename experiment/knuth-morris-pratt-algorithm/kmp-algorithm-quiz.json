      "question": "1. Which of the following is true in the KMP string searching algorithm? (strInd = iterator in the main string)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The value of strInd always increases in all iterations.",
        "b": "The value of strInd remains the same in all iterations.",
        "c": "The value of strInd may or may not increase in all iterations, but it never decreases.",
        "d": "None of the above."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. strInd can remain the same during a mismatch.",
        "b": "Incorrect. strInd does not always remain the same; it advances when characters match.",
        "c": "Correct. strInd may stay the same during a mismatch, but it never decreases in the KMP algorithm.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Option c is correct."

    {
      "question": "2. How does KMP improve the brute-force method?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By comparing the characters right to left instead of left to right.",
        "b": "By searching for text in the pattern instead of the pattern in the string.",
        "c": "By avoiding redundant comparisons and using information from previous matches.",
        "d": "All of the above."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. KMP compares left to right, not right to left.",
        "b": "Incorrect. KMP searches for the pattern in the string, not the other way around.",
        "c": "Correct. KMP uses the LPS array to avoid redundant comparisons, making it more efficient than brute-force.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Only option c is correct."
