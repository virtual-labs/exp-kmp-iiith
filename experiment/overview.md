### Estimated Time

2.5 hour

### Prerequisites of the Experiment

This experiment requires you to have basic knowledge about :

   - [Understanding of Prefix and Suffix of a String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substring)
   - [Notion of Time and Space complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity)

And above all, a curiosity to learn and explore!

### Overview of the Experiment

   - The aim of this experiment is to understand the intricacies of string searching and then delve further into the Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm, its Time and Space Complexity, and how it compares against naive searching algorithm.
   - The experiment features a series of modules with video lectures, interactive demonstrations, simulations, hands-on practice exercises and quizzes for self analysis.
