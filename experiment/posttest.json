    {
      "question": "1. What is the time complexity of the KMP algorithm? (M = length of pattern, N = length of string in which the pattern is searched)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "O(M×N)",
        "b": "O(M^N)",
        "c": "O(M+N)",
        "d": "None of these"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. O(M×N) is the time complexity of the naive string search algorithm, not KMP.",
        "b": "Incorrect. O(M^N) is not the correct complexity for KMP.",
        "c": "Correct. KMP preprocesses the pattern in O(M) time and searches the string in O(N) time, for a total of O(M+N).",
        "d": "Incorrect. Option c is correct."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is not the correct LPS array for the given pattern.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is not the correct LPS array for the given pattern.",
        "c": "Correct. The LPS (Longest Prefix-Suffix) array for 'AABAAC' is [0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0].",
        "d": "Incorrect. This is a duplicate of option c, but only one correct answer is needed."

      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. 8 is the starting index of the second match, not the first.",
        "b": "Incorrect. 10 is the ending index of the second match, not the starting index.",
        "c": "Correct. The first occurrence of 'SAT' in 'TSATLEADSAT' starts at index 1 (assuming 1-based indexing).",
