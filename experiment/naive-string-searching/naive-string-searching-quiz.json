      "question": "1. What is the time complexity of the Naive String Searching Algorithm? (N = length of the string, M = length of the pattern)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "O(N*M)",
        "b": "O(N+M)",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The naive string search checks each possible starting index in the string (O(N)), and for each, compares up to M characters (O(M)), resulting in O(N*M) time complexity.",
        "b": "Incorrect. O(N+M) is the complexity of more advanced algorithms like KMP.",
        "c": "Incorrect. O(N^M) is not the correct complexity for this algorithm.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Option a is correct."

      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The code implements the naive search algorithm and returns 1 if the pattern 'algo' is found in 'kmpalgo', which it is.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The pattern is present, so the output is not 0.",
