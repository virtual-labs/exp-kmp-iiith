      "answers": {
        "a": "Any combination of a subset of characters from a string in the same order as the string.",
        "b": "Contiguous sequence of characters within a string in the same order.",
        "c": "Any possible combination of the original set of characters present in the string.",
        "d": "None of these"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A subsequence is the subset of characters from a string in the same order as the string, but characters don't need to be contiguous.",
        "b": "Correct. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string in the same order.",
        "c": "Incorrect. A subset is any possible combination of the original set of characters present in the string, regardless of order.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Option b correctly describes a substring."

        "c": "go",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is a valid prefix as it is a substring with initial index 0 and final index 3.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is a valid prefix as it is a substring with initial index 0 and final index 8 (a complete string is also a prefix of itself).",
        "c": "Correct. A prefix of a string must be a substring where the starting index is 0. This is a substring with initial index 2 and final index 3, so it is not a prefix.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This is a valid prefix as it is a substring with initial index 0 and final index 1."

        "c": "labs",
        "d": "None of these"

      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is a substring with initial index 0 and final index 3, but a suffix must end at the last character of the string.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is a substring with initial index 1 and final index 3, but does not include the last character 's', so it is not a suffix.",
        "c": "Correct. This is a substring with initial index 1 and final index 4. Since the final index equals 4 (n-1 where n=5), it is a valid suffix of string \"vlabs\".",
        "d": "Incorrect. Option c is a valid suffix of the string."

      "question": "4. In the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm, what is the purpose of the prefix table (also called LPS array)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To store all possible prefixes of the pattern",
        "b": "To avoid unnecessary comparisons by utilizing information from previous matches",
        "c": "To count the number of characters in the pattern",
        "d": "To reverse the pattern for backward searching"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The prefix table does not store all prefixes, but rather the length of the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix for each position.",
        "b": "Correct. The LPS (Longest Proper Prefix which is also Suffix) array helps avoid unnecessary comparisons by determining how many characters can be skipped when a mismatch occurs.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The prefix table stores information about prefix-suffix patterns, not just the character count.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The KMP algorithm does not reverse the pattern; it uses the prefix table to optimize forward searching."

    {
      "question": "5. What is the time complexity of the KMP string matching algorithm for searching a pattern of length m in a text of length n?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "O(n * m)",
        "b": "O(n + m)",
        "c": "O(n^2)",
        "d": "O(m^2)"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is the time complexity of the naive string matching algorithm, not KMP. KMP optimizes this by avoiding redundant comparisons.",
        "b": "Correct. The KMP algorithm has a time complexity of O(n + m) where O(m) is for preprocessing the pattern to build the LPS array and O(n) is for searching through the text.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This would be highly inefficient. KMP achieves linear time complexity, not quadratic.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This complexity does not account for the text length n, which is essential in pattern matching."
