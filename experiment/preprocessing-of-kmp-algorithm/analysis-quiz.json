      "answers": {
        "a": "O(M^2)",
        "b": "O(M)",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The preprocessing function does not require quadratic time.",
        "b": "Correct. The preprocessing function for KMP computes the LPS array in O(M) time by iterating through the pattern once.",
        "c": "Incorrect. O(sqrt(M)) is not the correct complexity.",
        "d": "Incorrect. O(M^3) is much higher than required."

      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. 6 is not the correct length of the longest prefix-suffix.",
        "b": "Incorrect. 2 is not the correct length of the longest prefix-suffix.",
        "c": "Correct. The longest prefix-suffix for 'ANIDAPOPOANIDA' is 5, as the prefix and suffix 'ANIDA' match.",
        "d": "Incorrect. 3 is not the correct length of the longest prefix-suffix."
