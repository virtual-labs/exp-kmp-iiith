### Learning Objectives of this Module

In this module, we will be learning about :

   - Time and Space Complexity: We will learn about the running time of the preprocessing and KMP algorithm.
   - The preprocessing algorithm required for the KMP algorithm.
   - Comparison with the Naive string searching algorithm.
